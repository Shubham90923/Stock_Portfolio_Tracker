# Stock_Portfolio_Tracker

📊 Stock Portfolio Tracker

A simple and interactive command-line Python application that allows users to track their stock investments manually. This tool is designed for beginners and students who want to understand how stock tracking and investment calculations work using core Python concepts like dictionaries, user input, loops, and conditionals — no external libraries or APIs required.

🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide a minimal and functional stock portfolio tracker where users can input a stock symbol and quantity, and get the total investment value based on predefined stock prices. It serves as a great foundational exercise for understanding:
Data structures like dictionaries.
Building command-line tools.
Handling user input and basic validations.
Performing real-time calculations.

✅ Features

🔎 User Input Handling: Prompt the user to enter stock symbols and the number of shares owned.
🧠 Hardcoded Stock Prices: No API integration — prices are stored locally in a Python dictionary.
🧮 Instant Calculations: Each entry updates the total investment amount.
🔁 Loop Until Done: Keep adding stocks until the user types 'done'.
🛑 Error Handling: Detects and responds to invalid stock symbols or incorrect quantity input.
💬 User-Friendly Console Output: Clearly formatted messages make the app easy to use for beginners.
